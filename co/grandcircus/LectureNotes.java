*Graphs are essentially webs. Nonlinear connections between elements
*Tuples allow us to return more than 1 type of element (could return say a Double and a String)
*Hashtables - Not really used anymore. Would use a Hashmap instead. Key and value. 
*Arraylist - Dynamic array. Does not have to have a size declared. Better efficiency when retrieving an item from the list. 
*	Adding something to the beginning pushes all other items - inefficient
*Linkedlist - **Doubly efficient** series of nodes referencing the previous and successive nodes. Efficient to 
*	insert element anywhere, compared to other data structures. Just changes the pointers.
